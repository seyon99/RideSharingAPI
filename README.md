# RideSharingAPI

## About
A microservices REST API backend for a ride sharing app. The API has three microservices, which are as follows: `Location`, `User`, and `TripInfo`. It uses an API gateway to seperate external public APIs from internal microservice APIs, which utilizes multithreading to allow for concurrent requests.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Neo4j

Each microservice utilizes a different database technology, with MongoDB being used for the Trip Information microservice, PostgreSQL for the User microservice, and Neo4j being used for the Location microservice.
